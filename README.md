# Proiect POO 2025: SWIM!

Keep the rhythm of your stroke and breath in the water and complete random enemy encounters while collecting points!

# How to play:

Your breath will permanently run out, if you don't breathe correctly and regularly. When your breath runs out, it's game over!
The more consecutive strokes you have without breathing, the faster your breath will run out!

Minigame: Dodge the randomly spawning enemies in order to stay alive! Use the WASD keys to move the player.

Controls:

Q or E: Stroke (move your arms) in the water. Alternate both Q and E for more speed. Make sure to respect the timing given by the circle at the top of the screen! When the green outer circle touches the rim of the
blue inner circle, that is the best time to stroke!

W: Press W to make your next stroke be a "breath stroke"! What this means is that the next time you press Q or E, the player will take a restoring breath.

Best / Safest way to play (for now (this is subject to change)): Press Q when the timing is right, then W, and E, when the timing is right again. This should ensure that you don't run out of breath while moving and collecting points.

# Known bugs / lack of features: ( will be fixed / added in the near future)

1. It is very easily possible to stack infinite speed by not moving the cursor and repeating the same inputs.
2. Points can spawn above text, making them very hard to see and annoying to collect.
3. Player can be rotated off-screen when close to the edge of the window (not really a bug).
